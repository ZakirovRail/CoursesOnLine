** How to install pytest on venv:
1. $ pip3 install -U virtualenv
2. $ python3 -m virtualenv venv 
3. $ source venv/bin/activate
4. $ pip install pytest


Before running tests in these repo, you need to install the tasks_proj (be in core dir of the project):
$ pip install ./tasks_proj/

Running pytest:
$pytest --help

Run specific files with tests (if you in the directory with tests):
$ pytest test_three.py test_four.py

Only collect tests:
$ pytest --collect-only

Run tests marked with 'smoke' mark in verbose mode (means with details)
$ pytest -v -m 'smoke' 

Run tests and show extra test summary info for skipped tests, if there are (in tests) mentioned reasons why it's
skipping (using the 'skipif')
$ pytest -rs test_unique_id_3.py

To run a single test function, add :: and the test function name:
$ pytest -v tests/func/test_add.py::test_add_returns_valid_id

To run tests only for a specific Test Class:
$ pytest -v tests/func/test_api_exceptions.py::TestUpdate

To run ONE test only from a specific Test Class:
$ pytest -v tests/func/test_api_exceptions.py::TestUpdate::test_bad_id


To run tests that have certain names specified by the expression as a substring of the test name
$ pytest -v -k _raises

To run tests that have certain names specified by the expression as a substring of the test name and exclude som other tests
$ pytest -v -k "_raises and not delete"

====================================

Tests naming convention:

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the naming conventions to keep your test code discoverable by pytest:
1. Test files should be named test_<something>.py or <something>_test.py. 
2. Test methods and functions should be named test_<something>. 
3. Test classes should be named Test<Something>.

====================================
You can configure pytest to report the tests that pass but were marked with xfail to be reported as FAIL. 
This is done in a pytest.ini file:
[pytest]
xfail_strict=true
====================================

If you use fixtures for your tests, you can what's running and when:
$ $ pytest --setup-show test_add.py -k valid_id

====================================
Good idea to use in fixtures (and in test as well):
# GIVEN ....
# WHEN ....
# THEN ....

for GIVEN/WHEN/THEN and trying to push as much GIVEN into fixtures for two reasons. First, it makes the test more
readable and, therefore, more maintainable. Second, an assert or exception in the fixture results in an ERROR, while an
assert or exception in a test function results in a FAIL.

====================================
To lists all the fixtures available for the test, including ones that have been renamed

$ pytest --fixtures test_rename_fixture.py
